Task 1:

numb_1 = [[2, 4,1, 5], [2,10,12], [14, 16,20]]
Check the even numbers in the list. The output should be like the following:
  n is an even number.
  n is an odd number

and so on.


Task 2:

Write a function process_numbers(numbers, operation) that:

Takes a list of integers (numbers)

Takes an operation string ("double", "square", "cube", "filter_even", "sum")

Returns the result depending on the operation:

"double" -> return a new list with each number doubled

"square" -> return a new list with each number squared

"cube" -> return a new list with each number cubed

"filter_even" -> return a new list with only even numbers
and if there is an invalid parameter given for operation name then print invalid input.

Task 3:


even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]

Write a try catch block to print the fifth indexed number. (hint: here the 5th index is invalid. So we should get error for that. That's why you have write a try catch block)
